# DPOD: Domain-Specific Prompt Tuning for Multimodal Fake News Detection
In this work, we explore
whether out-of-domain data can help to improve out-of
context misinformation detection (termed here as multi
modal fake news detection) of a desired domain, eg. politics, healthcare, etc. Towards this goal, we propose a novel
framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt-tuning
using Out-of-Domain data). First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP
to extract features that helps to align the representations
of the images and corresponding text captions of both the
in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning
technique which leverages the training samples of all the
available domains based on the the extent they can be useful
to the desired domain.

## Dataset Collection
- The query images and captions are found in the NewsCLIPpings datasets (we use the merged balanced dataset) [[Link](https://github.com/g-luo/news_clippings)].
- The whole NewsCLIPpings dataset was used in our task.
## Running Code
### Creating the Environment to Run the Code
Create the environment from the given yml file using the command:
```
conda env create -f dpod_env.yml
```
Activate the environment using the command:
```
conda activate dpod_env
```


### For Creating the Domain Embedding and Storing it into the JSON file
```python
python3 make_dom_vector.py
```
### In order to train CLIP-ViT B/32 in the proposed Label Aware Manner to get A-CLIP
```python
python3 make_label_aware_clip.py
```
### Running CoOp + A-CLIP
```python
python3 make_label_aware_clip.py
```
### Running our Proposed DPOD Framework
```python
python3 main_ft_dpod.py
```

### Evaluating our Proposed DPOD Framework
```python
python3 evaluate_dpod.py
```
